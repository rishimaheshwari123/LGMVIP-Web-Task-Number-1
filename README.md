# LGMVIP-Web-Task-Number-1
I'm delighted to hear that I successfully completed my first task during your internship! Congratulations on this achievement! ðŸŽ‰

During your internship, I had the opportunity to work with React.js and CSS to accomplish your task. By leveraging the power of React.js, I was able to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces, while CSS allowed you to style and design the elements beautifully. This combination of technologies provided me with a robust foundation for building modern web applications.
