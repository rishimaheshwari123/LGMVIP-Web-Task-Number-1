# LGMVIP-Web-Task-Number-1
I'm delighted to hear that you successfully completed your first task during your internship! Congratulations on this achievement! ðŸŽ‰

During your internship, you had the opportunity to work with React.js and CSS to accomplish your task. By leveraging the power of React.js, you were able to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces, while CSS allowed you to style and design the elements beautifully. This combination of technologies provided you with a robust foundation for building modern web applications.
